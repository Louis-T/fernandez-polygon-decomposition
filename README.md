# fernandez-polygon-decomposition

Library for decomposing polygons with (or without) holes into a partition of convex polygons.

It implements some of the algorithms presented in two publications by [J Fern√°ndez](http://www.um.es/geloca/gio/josemain.html) :
* _Algorithms for the decomposition of a polygon into convex polygons_
* _A practical algorithm for decomposing polygonal domains into convex polygons by diagonals_
